    name: How to decide the level
    doc: |
      There are three achievement levels, A, AA, AAA.
      Level A includes "1.1.1 Non-text Content (which is not text, it is not subject to the screen reader of the visually impaired, and the visually impaired can not acquire any information unless special consideration is given)" and "2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap (If you create content that can not be accessed at all with the keyboard, it may interfere with users who can only use the keyboard)" "2.3 Seizures (If you have content that flashes on the page, Some users may cause symptoms of epilepsy) ", so to speak," success criterions achievement that should be considered at the minimum "is gathered.
      For level AA, level A is difficult to deal with in terms of budget and man-hours, but items that should be dealt with are added. For example, it will be required to give captions to live videos such as weather forecast (1.2.4), and to give recorded description (1.2.5) to recorded videos.
      For level AAA, it is required to take considerable sophistication such as giving sign language to recorded videos (1.2.6) or considering using difficult words (3.1.3 and 3.1.5). It is not recommended to target this level as a general policy.

#    name: How to select a page:"Web page unit"
#    doc: |
#      In the case of "Web page unit" check, it is necessary to target all the pages to be checked. For example, do not correspond "excluding movies". If the level can not be achieved by items that the page creator can not handle such as comment fields, please declare "partial adaptation".
#      In the case of "Web page unit" check, if the target page is part of a series of processes, please consider the whole series of processes. For example, this is the shopping cart payment process.
#      In this system, if you are targeting "web page unit", the site-wide accessibility report is not generated.

#    name: How to select pages:"Complete sets of web pages"
#    doc: |
#      In the case of "Complete sets of web pages" check, let's clarify which of "all" "random" "representative page" "random + representative page" is targeted.
#      "All" literally covers all pages.
#      For sites where the size of the website exceeds 100 pages, "random + representative page" is recommended. On the "representative page", the top page is obviously included, but please include pages that are considered to be the main content in the site.
#      Estimated number of extracts in "random" and "random + representative page" is safe if it is around 40 pages as a guide.

    name: Notes for securing accessibility with "non-text content (carousel / slide show)"
    doc: |
      "Carousel (slide show)" is often placed on the website. Carousel is convenient depending on the situation because multiple information can be set in one place and for many users to be conspicuous, but depending on the user it becomes a barrier (2-2-1b).
      Depending on the user, a component with automatic movement hinders concentration ability and may obstruct acquisition of information that you would like to obtain originally (2-2-2b).
      For carousel, please consider one of "Do not use" or "Do not autoplay" or "Provide easy-to-understand stop method".

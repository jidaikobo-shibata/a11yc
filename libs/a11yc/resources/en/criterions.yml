      There is an exception to omit alt in HTML5, but in order to apply this exception, please apply it after understanding the specification of HTML5 well. Even if this exception is applicable, this check tool issues a warning.
      If it is an imaged character, in principle, alt matching the image is given. In addition, please, if possible, please carefully examine whether you really want to image that character.
      Because the image of decorative purposes, have an alt in the sky. Even in this case, make sure to set <code>alt=""</code> and do not omit the alt attribute value. Incidentally, if you indicate that it is for decoration purposes with attribute values, such as <code>role="presentation"</code>, you will not get a warning when checking this accessibility checker. It is not a recommendation to abuse <code>role="presentation"</code>.
      Users in low-speed line environments may have turned off image display. The appropriate alt is also a judgment of "whether to display the image dared", please put it as carefully as possible.
      Since it is an image for skipping requests to images of other servers and analyzing logs, empty alt is inserted.
      There is an image, but there is a character string duplicated with the image in the vicinity, and alt is omitted. (If there is an image of Mr. A and there is written "Mr. A" in the vicinity thereof, "Mr. A" Alternatively, alt such as "Mr. A's image" may be easier to read for screen readers if omitting alt).
      In order to make it easy to distinguish between "imaged character" and "image", it is good to attach a prefix such as "photo: XX" or a descriptive alt like "XX photo". For example, alt "Japanese sweets" may bother to judge whether it is "imaged" the word "Japanese sweets" or "a picture of Japanese sweets".
      There are images of graphs and charts, but there is alt that explains what graphs and charts it is (e.g. "Sales graph of June, July, August"). Level A does not ask for a detailed description of the value of the graph, but of course there is a description of the value in the range that is possible. It is also good to have a table marked up with table nearby.
      Google Map is difficult for visually impaired people to handle, but explains "Google Map. Zoom and moveable map".
      There is an image of the map, it is difficult for the visually impaired to handle, but there is alt "map". However, if there is a text explanation etc. in the vicinity, alt can be empty but it will not be a fatal barrier. If there is no route explanation in the vicinity, and it is not clearly stating that it is an image of the map, you can not even ask people, so be sure to correct it as it is a barrier.
      The gif animation that explains how to operate some kind of instruments is difficult for the visually impaired, but it is difficult to understand for the visually impaired, but by describing the function by assigning alternative text such as "Animation explaining how to operate the instrument" . However, considering that 1-2-1d of the same level A is met in the end, it is better to try to explain as much as possible.
      If you are providing a speech in speech, this item is not applicable even if you substitute such alternative text of speech as "voice of the speech." By preparing transcribed text, it becomes "able to handle functions", so in the case of such speech, prepare transcribed text.
      It is a hearing-dependent test such as a hearing test.
      The image of the flower is displayed and it is an image that asks "Which part is calyx?" It clearly indicates that it is an image for testing purposes.
      If you prepare transcribed text with these images, movies and sounds, it will not be a test, so you will explain the purpose of the content with alternative text.
      "This sound is an example of sounds that people feel fear", "When looking at it is an image that loses sense of equilibrium", you explain that.
      It is almost impossible to transcribe "specific senses" and reproduce them in text, so these are out of the scope of accessibility checks.

      The information, structures, and relationships presented in some way are programmatically interpretable or provided in text.
    doc: |
      The meaning of information is not provided only by the color, size, and position of the element. Structures should be structured using h* or strong etc, so that information can be transmitted properly without CSS.
      Replace b and i elements with strong / em elements for emphasis purposes.
      For u, s, strike, basefont, center and font elements, please use CSS instead to separate structure and representation. In the case of s or strike it may be replaced by del element.
      Headings h1 to h6 should be descending in order. If h1 is a big headline, h2 is a middle headline, and h3 is a subheading, it is unnatural for h3 to appear next to h1.
      An example of NG would be such things as "the picture on the right ..." "red squares on the calendar ..." "items with red letters are required". However, providing information such as "The person on the upper right in the photo ..." is not this. Also note that this success criterion does not necessarily say <strong>that calendar holidays should not be represented in red</strong>. For those who do not know the color, there is no need to disturb the easy-to-understand person who understands the color, while providing it in a way that makes it clear.
      When using form, you can improve the accessibility of form by using label. In fact, in HTML 4.01, even if multiple labelable elements are included, it is not a grammar violation, but accessibility support is not very sure, so it is safer to have one-to-one correspondence for no particular reason.
      Many screen readers read the title attribute value of the input element etc. as a label, but if label and title are both written, it is safer to match them. Please pay attention to the title attribute that expected tooltip display from that point of view. Also, if you are expecting tooltip display, it is often displayed only with hover, and it seems that it is often not displayed in focus. Please pay attention to this point as well.
      placeholder attribute can not be used as label. Since the placeholder attribute becomes invisible when it is input, some screen-reder, can not read placeholder attribute.
      WAI-ARIA attributes aria-label and aria-labelledby are becoming widespread, but at the moment it is safer to have a label (or title) for screen readers.
      In the case of a table, it is desirable to make it meaningful by making it linear information. Moreover, it is even better that you can use thead, th etc correctly. It may be difficult for a technician to make the table linear information. Please think that the principle is "read from the upper left to the lower right." It is also effective to check with a screen reader.
      For forms, checkbox, radio, etc. should be marked up with label and associated. By doing so, the screen reader makes it easier to understand each item, making clicks easier for users who are difficult to use pointing devices such as a mouse.
      If there is a required item in the form, please do not provide information dependent only on the visual sense that it is a required item. For example, how to provide required items such as "items with red letters are required" is NG.

      Please do layout that makes use of line breaks and spaces so as not to disturb understanding of meaning. Not only does it make it difficult to obtain information with a screen reader if you align the end of a line with a new line, or arrange lines with spaces, it becomes hard to read even when changing font size. Also, as a measure against search engines, I will never work plus.

      Understanding WCAG 2.0 defines logos, font samples, etc. as "essential visual effect", which is clear and easy to understand, but for example, "I want to display with antialiasing in any environment" I really want to express this heading with this font by all means "It seems that it is good to say" it is not possible to express visual effects with CSS ".

      If the keyboard interface can be used to move the keyboard focus to a component of the webpage, it is possible to remove focus from that component using only the keyboard interface. Furthermore, if you can not remove focus by using arrow keys without a modifier key, Tab key, or other standard method of removing focus, the user is notified of the method of removing focus.

      "Keyboard trap" is an implementation that makes it impossible to escape from keyboard operation when focus shifts to an element. When creating a modal window etc., you have to be able to do it not only with the mouse but also with the keyboard to close it.

      If you need to set a time limit for content, the following consideration of Success Criterion 2.2.1 is required. Whether the time limit is sufficiently long (20 hours), the time limit can be canceled, the time limit can be adjusted to 10 times or more, the time can be extended, and the time limit must be inevitable for the contents (auction Etc).
      "Limited time" does not cover operation only. When there is a carousel, this is the time limit when you have to read the contents while the carousel switches automatically.
      Also be careful when you have movies and audios. There are users that also make it difficult to recognize these by setting a time limit.
      For movies, audios, carousels, it is difficult to think about measures to extend or adjust the time limit, but if you can pause and resume it, you will meet this success criterion (G4). As for carousel, please note that similar items are achieved in 2.2.2 and level A can not be acquired unless the user can stop.
      Please do not specify redirect etc. by refresh of meta element because it restricts time to read by user.

      Also, care should be taken when creating a modal dialog. For users who do not use screen readers, modal dialogs can not perform other actions until they close the modal dialog (that is, they are called "modal dialogs"). For users who use screen readers, they should behave in the same way, and there should be no such thing as moving out of the modal if you are focusing with the tab key.

In such cases, however, each link letters are not unique and "read more" or "detailed information here" If it is, it will become difficult to grasp what the link destination is.
      However, in 2.4.4 it is considered good to provide link letters depending on the context. For example, when the content of books is provided in HTML, PDF, MP3, only the first HTML contains the title of the book in the link letters, but it is considered good to read "PDF" "MP3".
      Also, <strong> if it is within the same paragraph </strong>, even so-called "here link" is also allowed, but for "here link" it is better not to use it much.
      It is not a fatal barrier and there is no regulation in the standard, but if the link destination is a downloading file such as PDF, it is a file and the size of the file is written together, who It will be useful as well.

    doc: |
      The link letters alone must be able to understand the purpose of the link. The difference from 2.4.4 is that it does not allow context dependence. Representing the example of "book" in 2.4.4, HTML version, PDF version, MP3 version must have book name in link letters respectively. However, if "the purpose of the link is ambiguous for most users", it does not seem to be limited to this, but the example of "guava" seems to be difficult for users without disabilities. The door example of "Understanding Success Criterion 2.4.4" may be easier to understand.
      there are often implementations that There is a title and it is linked, a little introduction sentence and "Read more" link to the same place as the title. In this case, "Read more" is not a link that can be understood by itself (by the way it is acceptable in 2.4.4). If you read "Read more" as "Read more about {title}", you can "understand independently", so 2.4.9 is satisfied. However, with a screen reader, reading while skipping to the link on the tab is a bit annoying as it reads similar functions in succession. In this case, you can use <code>aria-hidden="true"</code> or <code>tabindex="-1"</code> etc. in this case "Read more" (or "Read more about {title}") If you do, the number of tab key presses will be reduced, making comfortable use in the audio environment. By the way, in 3-2-4a, it is required that "components having the same function can be consistently identified". For example, it is forbidden that the link to the inquiry form of the site is "Contact" or "Contact Us page" and it is not unified (In other words, it is said to be consistent in "Contact" or "Contact Us page"). As in Section 2.4.9, it is considered that understanding the purpose of the link is not disturbing, but even if the character string of the link can be understood, different notation makes the user uneasy You may need to be conscious of it being there.

      Components having the same function in a set of web pages can be consistently identified.
    doc: |
      Links and buttons that provide the same function must be consistent in the set of web pages. This success criterion is easy to overlook. Even labels that seem almost self-evident, if they are not strictly consistent, can not meet this success criterion. In the case of nonconforming cases, the "find" button and the "search" button provide the same function, but this is not good because of different labels.
      Even when the link destination is the same and the link character string is different, it is also the target of attention (G 197). It seems that it is NG that the link destination of the inquiry page is "Contact" or "Contact Us page".
      Also, the link to the top page of a set of web pages may be "top", "to the top page", or the site name. Let's avoid notating the notation of these links within the content.
      It is a relatively common implementation that the logo image with the site name alt at the top of the page is the top page link. Also, at the same time, the link to the top page of breadcrumbs is often not a site name. Although the interpretation may be shaking, it is guaranteed consistency of the function "go to the top page when you click the site name logo" and the consistency of the function "let's go to the top page with the top in breadcrumbs" It is considered that this string does not have to match if it is done. See "Example 3:Consistent references to other pages" of "Understanding SC 3.2.4".
      By the way, please also check 2.4.9. In this "Contact" example, this item is not satisfied because the labels do not match, but in terms of "understanding the function of the link" required in 2.4.9, there is no problem I will.
      For example, it is dangerous from the point of view of 2.4.9 to think that the "link for reading article details" is a consistent label "here".

    summary: |
      A change in context only occurs at the request of the user, or a mechanism for stopping such change is available.
    doc: |
      It is desirable that all operations that can cause some change in the situation are controllable by the user. As long as 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 are cleared up, we will aim for this success criterion naturally, but as far as possible, leaving the chance of change to the user is an important point of this success criterion.
      If for some reason there is a behavior that automatically causes some change in the situation, it is necessary for the user to be able to stop the change.
      The interesting thing is the reference to Understanding about target = _blank. On the other hand, if it is explained in the link text that "Open in a new tab (window)", it is said that it is okay to do this, but it is better if you can not specify by target if possible. There is a case where it is convenient for most users to have target designation around here, which is quite troublesome.

    summary: |
      If an input error is detected automatically, the error location is identified and the error is explained in text to the user.
    doc: |
      If there are items that require mandatory items or values in a predetermined format to be entered, and if you do not want to accept the transmission unless it is entered correctly, display errors in an easy-to-understand way for the user. When displaying an error, for example, <strong> only </strong> changing the background color of mandatory items that are not entered is insufficient because the visually impaired person does not know the error (This does not mean that you should not change the color.Usability of sighted people improves by expressing colors.). It is necessary to explain the error with sentences.
      It is good to check the error before sending using JavaScript.

    summary: |
      When content requests input from the user, a label or explanatory text is provided.
    doc: |
      Provide information to users in an easy-to-understand manner as to where and when to ask the user for input to the form. It is even better to provide it in a way interpretable by the program. Specifically, by linking each form element with a label element, it is possible to create a form that is easy to use even for visually impaired people.
      Also, it is preferable to include descriptions and case examples of input, but if you do too much you will get in the way, so make it concise.
      When there is a required item, it is necessary to provide information in an easy-to-understand manner what is required.
      When writing descriptions and examples at the time of input, there is less mistake for users of screen readers who are linearly acquiring information by describing them before entry fields.

    summary: |
      If an input error is detected automatically and you can suggest a correction method, that suggestion is presented to the user. However, excluding cases where the purpose of security or content is impaired.
    doc: |
      When there is an error in the input contents, it is desirable to explain how to correct it. However, in the case of Understanding WCAG 2.0, we cite the case of "Please enter January" to the user who entered "12" for "Please enter month", but this is not a very good case I think. Rather, say "Please enter with alphabet (aZ) and number (0-9)" to issue an error if you are entering in half-width alphanumeric input for double-byte characters, It is better to refer to the perimeter (it is better to convert it to half-width alphanumeric characters by accepting input without issuing an error, but it will reduce user's effort, but such correspondence depends on case).
      The difference from 3.3.1 is a bit hard to understand, but the subject of 3.3.1 is to specify the error part and not to clarify how to correct the error.
      Also, it is said that it is desirable to give a link to an error part even in 3.3.1 or 3.3.3.

    summary: |
      For all user interface components (elements that make up the form, links, script-generated components, etc.), names and roles can be interpreted programmatically. In addition, the status, properties, and values that can be set by the user can be set by the program. Then, user agents including assistive technology can use change notifications for these items.
    doc: |
      Elements to be operated by the user need to be interpreted by the program if they have names, roles and values. When describing elements as usual in HTML, this is rarely a problem. However, even if you are describing HTML as usual, it is important to note that if span etc. receives focus and implements such as JavaScript that causes some change in content.
